Elbonia one: so the solution seems ok to describe in words, but not sure how much detail to go into with pseudocode. 
did you have to define any other algorithms you used? (e.g. bfs) or is sort of talking in vague terms ok 
e.g. 
for each road
    add road to highway graph
    for each intersection on highway
        if pathExists(currentIntersection, currentIntersection) 
        //make sure first intersection always taken without change dir
        return true
    done
done
    return false
