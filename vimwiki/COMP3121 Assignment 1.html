Question 2
<pre>
    
    Problem Statement:
    - In a room of 20 people (including himself) Tom got 19 different answers from other people (wife included) (1)
    - Nobody shook hands with themselves (2)
    - Nobody shook hands with their spouse (3)
    
    To show the number of hands Tom shook, first show that Mary shook 9 hands.
    - Combining (1) with (2) and (3), of the group the highest number of handshakes for an individual
    was 18 (-1 for each condition). (Someone knew nobody)
    - From 1), someone also knew everyone and shook 0 hands, as range 0..18 gives 19 unique shake combinations 
    - The person who shook 0 hands (P0) is married to the one who shook 18 (P18). 
        (Everyone BUT P18's wife shook hands with him. So, P0 must be the only person who didn't - his wife)
       
    Consider the below:
    
    | Couples remaining | Range(min) | Range(max) | Removed couples | Effective 'new' handshakes |
    |-------------------|------------|------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
    | 8                 | 0          | 18         | 0               | 0 .. 18                    |
    | 7                 | 1          | 17         | 1               | 0 .. 16                    |
    | 6                 | 2          | 16         | 2               | 0 .. 15                    |
    | ..                | ..         | ..         | ..              | ..                         |
    | ..                | ..         | ..         | ..              | ..                         |
    | ..                | ..         | ..         | ..              | ..                         |
    | 2                 | 7          | 11         | 8               | 0 .. 4                     |
    | 1                 | 8          | 10         | 9               | 0 .. 2                     |
    
    Logic: Wife shook 9 hands.
    From table, can see relationship between spouse. Since Tom was Mary's spouse and participating in the
    Handshakes, he contributed to the handshake range above.
    
     {{$
     \sum_i a_i^2
     =
     1
     nshakes = total - nspouse
     nspouse = 9
     ntom = 18 - 9 = 9 shakes also.
