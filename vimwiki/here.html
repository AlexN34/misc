<p>
In general, if you have an abstract base class that declares only public abstract methods and public static final fields, you may as well make it an interface. Because an abstract class is restricted to single inheritance, but an interface can be multiply inherited, an interface is more flexible than an abstract class. If you want to have any default implementation of methods, or non-public members in the base class, however, it must be an abstract class.

</p>

<p>
Generics involve specifying Objects in type definition so that compiler checks
type when things are typed out
=&gt; less mistakes as programmer does not have the responsibility to do this
</p>


<p>
Generics implement type variables which act as parameters and provide info
compiler needs to make checks
Generic classes take type variables as input and use them to implement
themselves differently
</p>

<p>
Using generics allows autobox/unbox - performance peanlty
</p>

<p>
Wildcards
Covariance: use ? extends T
If used, you can't add anything of subtype to the structure -- ? means unknown subtype --
can't be sure if it's the right one to add.
However, this ensures that it is subtype of T =&gt; can use T's methods on these
objects with guarantee 
</p>


<p>
USE IF YOU NEED TO GET STUFF
Contravariance: use ? super T
</p>

<p>
Guarantees reference is supertype of T - can add things of the subtypes. Won't
compile if you try to add supertypes
Get data? can only get Object instances as supertype cannot be assured
Object is the 'master' class =&gt; super type of all classes so everything will
be an Object
USE IF YOU NEED TO PUT STUFF
</p>

<p>
IF BOTH PUT AND GET NEEDED, DON'T WILDCARD
"PRODUCER EXTENDS, CONSUMER SUPER"
</p>

<p>
Wildcard restores LSP (substitution) to Generics - just have to have single
purpose
