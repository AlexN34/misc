Aims
</p>

<p>
This exercise aims to give you practice in:
asking SQL queries on a relatively simple schema
using SQL aggregation and grouping operators
writing SQL view definitions
This exercise will not explain how to do everything in fine detail. Part of the aim of the exercise is that you explore how to use the PostgreSQL system. The documentation contains much useful information: PostgreSQL Manual. You should become familiar with where to find useful information in the documentation ASAP; you will need to know how to use PostgreSQL for the assignments.
Background
</p>

<p>
Access logs for web servers contain a considerable amount of information that is potentially useful in tuning both the web server parameters and the applications that run on the web server. A web server access log contains one entry for each page that is fetched from that server, where a page may be an HTML document, a PHP script, an image, etc. Each log entry contains information about one page access, including:
</p>

<p>
the IP address of the host from which the page request was made
the precise date/time that the request was made
the URL that was requested (path name relative to server document root)
the status of the fetch operation (e.g. 200 = successful, 404 = not found)
the number of bytes of data transferred to the requestor
Here is an example from the start of the March 2005 log from the Apache web server on mahler:
</p>

Some Web-based applications such as WebCMS introduce the notion of a session to a user's interaction with the web server. A user logs in to WebCMS, performs a series of page accesses (e.g. looks the the lecture notes, reads the message board, etc) and then logs out. All of these accesses are tied together by being part of a single user's interaction with the system. In an older version of WebCMS, sessions were implemented by passing a session identifier from one PHP script to the next, and checking this against a copy of the session identifier stored in the database. Thus, while the web log itself does not store information about users, it is possible to track an individual user's access to the system by finding all of the page accesses that make use of the same session identifier.
</p>

<p>
For the purposes of this exercise, imagine that we are interested in finding out the typical things that people do in a session with WebCMS. Some of this we can guess: they check the NoticeBoard, take a look whether there are any new lecture notes, read the current prac exercise, etc. Analysing the actual data in detail allows us to either confirm our hunches or discover new (unexpected) ways in which people use the system. Either way, this information could give us ideas on how to tune the performance of WebCMS.
</p>

<p>
It is very convenient to do this kind of analysis if the data is loaded into a relational database system, so the first step is to put the web log data into a relational form that captures the essential aspects of WebCMS sessions. Based on this, it is possible to define a database schema to represent the data from a WebCMS web log:
</p>

<p>
the IP address and names of various host computers
information about each session using WebCMS, including which host it was from and whether the user actually logged out via the WebCMS logout page (if they don't logout, their session is eventually timed-out)
the details of each individual page access, including the name of the script, the parameters, the access time, and the session that the access was part of
We use the following ER design:
</p>


<p>
which has been converted to a relational schema.
create table Hosts (
	id          integer,
	ipaddr      varchar(20) unique,
	hostname    varchar(100),
	primary key (id)
);
</p>

<p>
create table Sessions (
	id          int, 
	host        integer,
	complete    boolean,
	primary key (id),
	foreign key (host) references Hosts(id)
);
</p>

<p>
create table Accesses (
	session     int,
	seq         int,
	course      int,
	page        varchar(200),
	params      varchar(200),
	accTime     timestamp,
	nbytes      integer,
	primary key (session,seq),
	foreign key (session) references Sessions(id)
);
This schema is written in standard SQL, and so will load in any standard-conforming SQL database management system.
</p>

<p>
An Apache web-server on the CSE mahler runs the WebCMS system. The web server log for the first three days of March 2005 from this server was pre-processed to fit the schema above and is available for you load into a database.
</p>

<p>
The data has been placed into three files, each of which consists of a large number of SQL insert statements.
</p>

<p>
-rw-r--r--  1 YOU  YOU  5568874 31 Mar 16:58 Accesses.sql
-rw-r--r--  1 YOU  YOU   172536 31 Mar 16:09 Hosts.sql
-rw-r--r--  1 YOU  YOU   193407 31 Mar 21:03 Sessions.sql
Note that these data files are quite large, so you shouldn't leave them lying around under your home directory unless you have a large disk quota. However, it would be feasible to place them under your /srvr/YOU/ directory since you have a reasonable disk quota on grieg, which is separate from and additional to your "home" quota. If your disk on /srvr/YOU is not enough, you should consider delete your previous lab database or the source code of postgres.
</p>

<p>
We have also supplied a copy of the schema to build the database table structures and a template file for the exercises:
</p>

<p>
-rw-r--r--  1 YOU  YOU      657 31 Mar 16:10 schema.sql
-rw-r--r--  1 YOU  YOU     2243 31 Mar 16:11 weblog.sql
We have created a ZIP file containing all of the above files for you to download and use for this Prac. Since the data files are quite large (e.g. Accesses.sql is 5MB), you might want to put them under your /srvr/YOU/ directory rather than under your home directory. Note that you can access /srvr/YOU/ from an xterm on any CSE workstation without needing to log in to grieg.
</p>

<p>
The first thing to do is to make a directory for this Prac and extract a copy of the data files into this directory. On the CSE workstations, you can do this via:
</p>

<p>
% unzip weblog.zip
while you're in the directory where you want the files to be located.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, if you're working on this at home, you should download the weblog.zip file your home machine and run the command:
</p>

<p>
% unzip weblog.zip
In the examples below, we assume that you have already done this.
</p>

<p>
Setting up the PostgreSQL database
</p>

<p>
Once you have copies of the schema and data files, you can setup a PostgreSQL database for this Prac via the following sequence of commands on your PostgreSQL server on grieg:
</p>

<p>
% createdb weblog
CREATE DATABASE
% psql weblog -f schema.sql
  ... should produce CREATE TABLE messages ...
% psql weblog -f Hosts.sql
  ... should produce lots of INSERT messages ...
% psql weblog -f Sessions.sql
  ... should produce lots of INSERT messages ...
% psql weblog -f Accesses.sql
  ... should produce lots of INSERT messages ...
</p>
  
<p>
Each INSERT statement should look like:
</p>

<p>
INSERT 0 1
The 1 means that one tuple was inserted. You can insert multiple tuples in a single SQL statement, so this number could potentially be different to 1. The 0 means that no object ID was generated for the new tuple. PostgreSQL can generate a unique ID for each tuple if you ask.
</p>

<p>
An alternative way of achieving the above is:
</p>

<p>
% createdb weblog
CREATE DATABASE
% psql weblog
psql (9.0.3)
Type "help" for help.
</p>

<p>
weblog=#  \i schema.sql
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
weblog=#  \i Hosts.sql
... should produce lots of INSERT messages ...
weblog=#  \i Sessions.sql
... should produce lots of INSERT messages ...
weblog=#  \i Accesses.sql
... should produce lots of INSERT messages ...
If you don't want to look at at all of the INSERT messages, and you're using Linux or Mac OSX, then you can do the following:
</p>

<p>
% createdb weblog
CREATE DATABASE
% psql weblog -f schema.sql
  ... should produce CREATE TABLE messages ...
% (psql weblog -f Hosts.sql 2&gt;&amp;1) &gt; .errs
  ... INSERT messages are added to file .errs ...
% (psql weblog -f Sessions.sql 2&gt;&amp;1) &gt;&gt; .errs
  ... INSERT messages are added to file .errs ...
% (psql weblog -f Accesses.sql 2&gt;&amp;1) &gt;&gt; .errs
  ... INSERT messages are added to file .errs ...
Note that the first loading command has only one &gt; to create the .errs file, while the other loading commands use &gt;&gt; to append to the .errs file. A useful command, once you've run the above is:
</p>

<p>
% grep ERROR .errs
to check for any load-time errors. If there are any errors (and there shouldn't be), all of the tuples except the incorrect ones will have been loaded into the database. Using the line numbers in the error messages, you should be able to find any erroneous INSERT statements and correct them, and then re-run just those statements.
</p>

<p>
Once the database is loaded, access it via psql to check that everything was loaded ok:
</p>

<p>
% psql weblog
psql (9.0.3)
Type "help" for help.
</p>

<p>
weblog=# \d
</p>

</p>

<p>

<p>

Note that this is a non-trivial-sized database, and if you are not careful in how you phrase your queries, they make take quite a while to be answered. It might be useful to run your psql session with timing output turned on (use psql's \timing command to do this). If a query takes too long to produce a result, see if you can phrase it differently to get the same answer, but using less time.
</p>

<p>
Another thing to note: the first time you access a table after creating it (e.g. to run the above counting queries), the query may be quite slow. On subsequent accesses to the table, it may be significantly faster. Try re-running the above queries to see if you observe this. Can you suggest why it's happening?
</p>

<p>
Exercises
</p>

<p>
In the questions below, you are required to produce SQL queries to solve a range of data retrieval problems on this schema. For each problem, create a view called Qn which holds the top-level SQL statement that produces the answer (this SQL statement may make use of any views defined earlier in the Prac Exercise). In producing a solution for each problem, you may define as many auxiliary views as you like.
</p>

<p>
To simplify the process of producing these views, a template file (weblog.sql) is available. While you're developing your views, you might find it convenient to edit the views in one window (i.e. edit the weblog.sql file containing the views) and copy-and-paste the view definitions into another window running psql.
</p>

<p>
Note that the order of the results does not matter (except for the examples where you are imposing an order using order by). As long as you have the same set of tuples, your view is correct. Remember that, in theory, the output from an SQL query is a set.
</p>

<p>
Once you have completed each of the view definitions, you can test it simply by typing:
</p>

<p>
weblog=# select * from Qn;
and observing whether the result matches the expected result given below.
</p>

<p>
Queries in PostgreSQL
</p>

<p>
How many of the page accesses occurred on March 2?
</p>

<p>
The results should look like:
</p>

<p>
   weblog=# select * from Q1;
</p>
<blockquote>
nacc  
</blockquote>
<p>
   -------
</p>
<blockquote>
20144
</blockquote>
<p>
   (1 row)
How many times was the main WebCMS MessageBoard search facility used? You can recognise this by the fact that the page contains messageboard and the parameters string contains state=search.
</p>

<p>
The result should look like:
</p>

<p>
weblog=# select * from Q2;
 nsearches 
<hr />
</p>
<blockquote>
0
</blockquote>
<p>
(1 row)
(Note: if you get 1 as the count, you're probably picking up a search on one of the WebGMS messageboards, which is not a usage of the main WebCMS MessageBoard.)
</p>

<p>
On which (distinct) machines in the Tuba Lab were WebCMS sessions run that were not terminated correctly (i.e. were uncompleted)?
</p>

<p>
The result should look like:
</p>

<p>
weblog=# select * from Q3;
</p>
<blockquote>
hostname             
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>
 tuba00.orchestra.cse.unsw.edu.au

(Hint: the Sessions.complete attribute tells you whether a given session was completed)
</p>

<p>
What are the minimum, average and maximum number of bytes transferred in a single page access? Produce all three values in a single tuple, and make sure that they are all integers.
</p>

<p>
The result should look like:
</p>

<p>
weblog=# select * from Q4;
 min | avg  |  max   
-----+------+--------

How many of the sessions were run from CSE hosts? A CSE host is one whose host name ends in cse.unsw.edu.au. Ignore any machines whose hostname is not known.
</p>

<p>
The result should look like:
</p>

<p>
weblog=# select * from Q5;
 nhosts 
<hr />
   1380
(1 row)
How many of the sessions were run from non-CSE hosts? A non-CSE host is one whose host name does not end in cse.unsw.edu.au. Ignore any machines whose hostname is not known.
</p>

<p>
The result should look like:
</p>

<p>
weblog=# select * from Q6;
 nhosts 
<hr />
   2785
(1 row)
How many page accesses were there in the longest session (number of page accesses)?
</p>

<p>
The result should look like:

Each Accesses tuple indicates an access to a single WebCMS page/script. Produce a list of pages and their access frequency (i.e. how many times each is accessed).
</p>

<p>
The result should look like:
</p>

<p>
weblog=# select * from Q8 order by freq desc limit 10;
</p>
<blockquote>
page              | freq 
</blockquote>
<p>

WebCMS is divided into modules, where the PHP scripts for each module is contained in a subdirectory. We can work out the module name by looking at the first component of the script name (e.g. in the sample output above, notice, course, lecture, etc. are modules). Produce a table of modules and their access frequency (i.e. how many times each is accessed).
</p>

<p>
The result should look like:
</p>

<p>
weblog=# select * from Q9 order by freq desc limit 10;
</p>
<blockquote>
module    | freq  
</blockquote>
<p>
--------------+-------
 course       | 18602
 notice       |  9859
 webgms       |  8122
 lecture      |  3903
 messageboard |  2354
 creation     |  1884
 login        |  1776
 intro        |  1720
 class        |  1375
 lab          |  1216
(10 rows)
Hint: you'll need to find out more about PostgreSQL string operators and regular expressions.
Note: not all page URLs contain the '/' character; a page URL that looks simply like 'lecture' should be treated as a reference to the lecture module.
</p>

<p>
The script that maps the web log into relational tuples isn't perfect. Has it produced any sessions that have no corresponding accesses? Write a view to print the session IDs of any such sessions.
</p>

<p>
The result should look like:
</p>

<p>
weblog=# select * from Q10;
 session 
<hr />
